			<p>These fish tacos taste just like home. I'm from San Diego. Serve with homemade
				pico de gallo and lime wedges to squeeze on top.</p>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1 quart oil for frying</li>
				<li>1 pound cod fillets, cut into 2 to 3 ounce portions</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
				<li>1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas</li>
				<li>½ medium head cabbage, finely shredded</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Make beer batter: Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Blend beer and egg in a separate bowl, then quickly stir into
					flour mixture until combined with a few lumps remaining.</li>
				<li>Make white sauce: Mix together yogurt and mayonnaise in a medium bowl. Gradually stir in fresh lime juice until consistency is slightly runny.
					Season
					with jalapeño, capers, cayenne, oregano, cumin, and dill.</li>
				<li>Start fish tacos: Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
				<li>Dust fish pieces lightly with flour. Dip into beer batter, then fry in hot oil until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels.</li>
				<li>Lightly fry tortillas in hot oil until just crisped, but not too crisp. Drain on paper towels.</li>
				<li>Place fried fish in tortillas; top with shredded cabbage and white sauce.</li>
